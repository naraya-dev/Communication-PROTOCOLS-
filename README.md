## ✨ Highlights
- Read sensors: **DHT20 (temp/humidity over I²C)** and **HC-SR04 (ultrasonic distance)**
- Transport the readings between microcontrollers using multiple **wired** and **network** protocols
- **Benchmark** throughput, latency, CPU usage, code complexity, and wiring cost
- Reusable **Arduino/ESP** examples for each protocol
